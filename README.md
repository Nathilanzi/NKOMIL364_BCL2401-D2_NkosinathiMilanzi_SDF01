Project Overview; In this project, I'll dive into the world of web development and get hands-on experience with HTML. I'll create a simple portfolio webpage for "CodeSpace Cat" from scratch based on a provided reference image. This project is designed to help me understand the fundamental elements of HTML, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, and forms, while building an actual webpage.
